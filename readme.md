# YouTube Video Downloader and Merger

This Python script allows users to download YouTube videos, combining the highest quality video and audio streams available, and save them as a single MP4 file.

## Features

- Downloads the highest quality video (itag 248) and audio (itag 140) streams separately
- Merges video and audio into a single MP4 file
- Sanitizes filenames to avoid issues with special characters
- Creates a `downloads` directory to store the files

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- moviepy
- pytube
- os (built-in)
- re (built-in)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Install the required packages:

```
pip install moviepy pytube
```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

```
python youtube_downloader.py
```

2. When prompted, enter the URL of the YouTube video you want to download.
3. The script will download the video and audio streams, merge them, and save the final video in the `downloads` directory.

## Notes

- The script uses specific itags (248 for video and 140 for audio). If these streams are not available for a particular video, the script will notify you.
- Temporary video and audio files are deleted after the merge process.
- If an error occurs during the process, an error message will be displayed.

## Disclaimer

This script is for educational purposes only. Make sure you have the right to download and use the content as per YouTube's terms of service.
